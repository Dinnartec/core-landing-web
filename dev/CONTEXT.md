## What is Dinnartec?

Dinnartec is a technology company founded by developers with an ambitious vision: to build technological solutions that transform industries. We are not a traditional agency or a conventional consultancy. We are builders who combine technical execution with strategic thinking.

We are born with the mindset of the great technology companies, understanding that the path to get there is built step by step, project by project, solution by solution.

### Dinnartec Factory

**What it is:** Our proprietary products vertical. This is where we build solutions that scale globally.

## Principles

1. **Results over activity** — We don't measure success by hours worked but by impact generated.

2. **Build over consult** — We prefer to execute rather than just recommend. We are builders, not advisors.

3. **Repeat to scale** — We document everything. If something works, we systematize it. If it repeats, we productize it.

4. **Ambition with patience** — We want to be big, but we understand it's built step by step.

5. **Technology with purpose** — We don't implement technology for trends. Every solution must solve a real problem.

We are developers with experience in tech companies, specialized in backend and frontend, with a passion for building products that make an impact.
